# Directives

CSPect starts out by adding a basic list of directives available from [MDN fetch directives](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#directives)

To add additional directives, go to the "Directives" tab of the CSPect Custom Manager Page, and select "Create Directive"

This will open a popup window allowing you to select a new directive from a list of valid directives:

To edit an existing directive, right-click on the directive in the grid and select "Update Directive"

This will take you to the Directive Management page, where you can assign sources.
