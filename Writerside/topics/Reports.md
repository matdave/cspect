are shown in the "Reports" tab of the CSPect Custom Manager Page.

The view report window will give you detailed information about the cause of a report. From here you can either ignore
the report, or click the "Auto Fix" button if you would like to generate an exception.

The "Auto Fix" button should remove any related reports.
