# Sources

CSPect starts out with a very basic list of sources, including 'self', 'unsafe-inline', 'unsafe-eval', 'data:', and 'blob:'

To add additional sources, go to the "Sources" tab of the CSPect Custom Manager Page, and select "Create Source"

To edit an existing source, right-click on the source in the grid and select "Update Source"

This will take you into the Source Management page. Here you can add/remove directives from a source, or assign contexts
to a source.
